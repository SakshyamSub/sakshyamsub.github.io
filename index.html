      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I’m Sakshyam Subedi, a 18-year-old student from Bakulahar, Chitwan,
        currently studying in Grade 12 (Management stream) at Ankuram Academy.
        I'm a creative learner who loves exploring the world of technology,
        especially web development and design. I enjoy building websites and
        bringing ideas to life through code. Outside of tech, I’m a passionate
        gamer, I love playing Valorant, the Assassin’s Creed series, and many
        other games. I’m also really into sports, especially cricket and
        football, which keep me active and motivated. Whether I’m gaming,
        coding, or on the field, I’m always eager to learn and grow. When i'm
        feeling tired, i remember the number 13 which makes me feel motivated
        because that's my favourite number and my lucky number too 😊.

      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Outside of coding and learning, I’m a huge fan of gaming and sports. I
        love playing
        <strong>Valorant</strong>, exploring story-driven titles like
        <strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong>, and discovering new games that
        challenge my thinking and reflexes. Gaming helps me stay sharp,
        creative, and connected with people.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not in front of a screen, you’ll probably find me on a field.
        I’m passionate about playing
        <strong>cricket</strong> and <strong>football</strong>, both of which
        have taught me the value of teamwork, patience, and discipline. Whether
        it’s gaming or sports, I always look for ways to improve and enjoy every
        moment.
